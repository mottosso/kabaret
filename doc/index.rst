   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

**Kabaret** is a free and open source Digital Studio Framework.

It provides modules and tools to set up a complete production line in no time, with
robustness and scalability.

Kabaret has been developed to build the `Supamonks Studio <http://www.supamonks.com>`_ guts: **Kabaret Studio**.

Like Kabaret framework, the Kabaret Studio is free and open source. You may use it directly or extend it for 
your needs.
It is also a great example of Kabaret framework usage.

The Kabaret Studio is presented in videos and screenshots on the 
`studio forum <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kabaret-studio/eGp-0m47bwM/zfDuEwPOMKkJ>`_.

If you are interested in discovering how Kabaret brings to you cutting edge Digital Studio solutions, 
we recommand the installation of the Kabaret Studio. See the `Installation instructions <install.html>`_ 
and the `Studio Documentation <kabaret_studio.html>`_.
Support can be found on the studio forum: `kabaret-studio <http://groups.google.com/group/kabaret-studio>`_ 
and the development forum: `kabaret-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/kabaret-dev>`_
